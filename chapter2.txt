Chapter 2

 Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile 
levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate
revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious 
suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget 
that, as my father snobbishly suggested, 
and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
